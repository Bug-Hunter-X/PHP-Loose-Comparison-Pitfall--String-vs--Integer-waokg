The solution is to use the strict comparison operator `===` which checks for both value and type equality.

```php
<?php
$value = "1000";
$limit = 1000;

if ($value === $limit) {
  echo "Values are strictly equal.";
} else {
  echo "Values are not strictly equal.";
}
?>
```

By employing strict comparison, the code accurately reflects that a string "1000" is not strictly equal to an integer 1000, preventing potential unexpected behavior in the application.
