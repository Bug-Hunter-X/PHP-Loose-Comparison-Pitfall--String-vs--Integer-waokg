This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  Specifically, the loose comparison `==` can lead to unexpected results when comparing a string and an integer.

```php
<?php
$value = "1000";
$limit = 1000;

if ($value == $limit) {
  echo "Values are equal.";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal.";
}
?>
```

While the string "1000" and the integer 1000 appear to be equal, the loose comparison `==` in PHP will evaluate them as equal due to automatic type coercion. This can cause problems if strict equality is required.
